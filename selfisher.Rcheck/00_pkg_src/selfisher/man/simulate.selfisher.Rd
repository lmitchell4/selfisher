\title{Simulate from a selfisher fitted model}
\usage{
\method{simulate}{selfisher}(object, nsim = 1, seed = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{selfisher fitted model}

\item{nsim}{number of response lists to simulate. Defaults to 1.}

\item{seed}{random number seed}

\item{...}{extra arguments}
}
\value{
returns a list of vectors. The list has length \code{nsim}.
Each simulated vector of observations is the same size as the vector of response variables in the original data set.

Simulate from a selfisher fitted model
}
\details{
Random effects are also simulated from their estimated distribution.
Currently, it is not possible to condition on estimated random effects.
